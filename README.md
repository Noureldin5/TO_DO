# Interactive To-Do List

A simple React-based to-do list application. This app includes task addition, deletion, and a base for backend interaction.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a title and an optional due date.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Checkboxes are used to mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Tasks can be reordered by dragging and dropping them.
- **Task Filtering**: Filter tasks to view All, Completed, or Incomplete tasks.
- **Backend Integration**: Tasks are stored and managed in a backend, which can be easily switched out for a custom API.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **React DnD**: Library for implementing drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to interact with the API.
- **JSONPlaceholder**: A free fake online REST API used to simulate the backend (can be replaced with your own backend).
